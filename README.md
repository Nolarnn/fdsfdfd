Beam.java and Finaljava.java pre cMaterials and whatever other chaos I might be switching around here soon when I move info from Beam.java to FinalJava.java to make it Beam more like an object instead of just another file.


More recent Beam.java and FinalJava.java have cMaterials but are not working bc they are for a different object that the one I need to create and test.
